# -Fileencrypter-

Sample file encrypter I wrote just to challenge myself.

To try this, I recommend using a virtual machine or cloud computer to avoid accidentally messing up your computer because it encrypts recursively. 

To try this, go into your terminal and type:

```git clone https://github.com/Kadefrfr/-Fileencrypter-```

I'll let you figure out the rest. That way, if you don't know what you're doing, you won't break something.
